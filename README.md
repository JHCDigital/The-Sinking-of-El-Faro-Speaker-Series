# The S.S. El Faro
The S.S. El Faro was built in 1975 and served as a cargo vessel for forty years. It regularly sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. On September 29, 2015, the ship left Jacksonville, Florida’s harbor on what was expected to be a routine trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There was a hurricane brewing in the line of their path named Joaquin, but at that time it was only declared a tropical storm. It only took a few days for Joaquin to escalate to a category 4 hurricane. El Faro pressed on despite the increasing risks, tragically underestimating the storm’s strength and trajectory. With the force of the storm the waves and wind crashed into the vessel, causing structural and mechanical challenges to expose themselves. The lower levels of the ship began to flood due to an open scuttle. The flooding caused the cargo to shift around, making the ship lose stability and list. Not long after the ship lost propulsion. With the El Faro unable to maneuver the crew worked tirelessly to manage the flooding, maintain communications with the Coast Guard and right the ship. Desite the crew's efforts the El Faro was compromised and overwhelmed by the storm’s intensity. 

The crew of the EL Faro displayed remarkable bravery and professionalism as they faced issues that few mariners ever encounter. The crew followed procedures, relayed information and did everything they could to save the ship and each other. Thanks to investigations of the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Woods Hole Oceanic Institution the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was able to be recovered. The recordings captured the final 26 hours of the crew. At approximately 7:30 a.m. on October 1, Captain Michael Davidson reported that the ship had lost propulsion and was taking on water. By 10:00 a.m. all communication ceased. The El Faro and its crew were lost to the sea. A month later, on October 31, 2015, the wreckage was discovered near the Bahamas, approximately 15,000 feet below surface.

# Investigation
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the U.S. Coast Guard launched investigations after the loss of the El Faro and its crew. They were determined to find out what happened and how to prevent an occurrence like this in the future. The NTSB recommended safety enhancements while the U.S. Coast Guard assigned blame and recommended operational improvements. Both investigations led to identifying the contributing factors and command failures surrounding the loss. The NTSB came out with several safety recommendations and called for stricter regulations and oversight on older vessels.[^1] They directly addressed the U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Communications Commission, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, TOTE Services Inc., amongst others in order to thouroughly identify and redirect those entities to make the changes needed. The U.S. Coast Guard called for more attentive oversight by the Alternate Compliance Program (ACP) and recommended civil penalties against TOTE Maritime. In addition to that they offered several safety suggestions which included requiring the replacement of all open life boats and 


# Honoring the crew of the El Faro
Ten years have passed since October 1, 2015, still the memory of that day is deeply felt by families, friends, and the entire maritime community. In El Faro's wake came a lasting change through improvements in safety, communication, and oversight. Their legacy run every vessel that sails safer because of them, in every mariner who remembers their story, and in every heart that still carries their names.

These names are recognized at the memorials placed in Dames Point Park, Jacksonville, Florida and STAR Center in Dania Beach, Florida for the El Faro crew members. The Jacksonville location features the "El Faro memorial" which centers a bronze lighthouse statue; a reference to the El Faro's name origin meaning "lighthouse". As well as 33 individual markers with a photo and nameplate for each of the lost crew mamebers. The Dames Point Park stands underneath the Dames Point Bridge, which faces the waters that the ship departed from, along the St. Johns River.[^2] The other memorial is in the heart of the STAR Center and displays the El Faro monument. The structure was unvieled September 29, 2018 and stands in a butterfly garden on the American Maritime Officers Plans campus. It was the focus of the 10 year anniversary memorial service AMO unions and stakeholders attend in remeberance of the El Faro on October 1, 2025.[^3]

# JHC Exhibit
## Curated by Research Archivist Shawn Stermer
Jacksonville has extensive ties to the maritime industry and that certainly reflects through the JHC archival collection. This physical exhibit focused on the history of those ties and how naval activity has shaped the city's identity as a whole. There were plenty of artifacts to look at as the exhibit featured items like maps, blueprints, model ships, pins, coins, cuffliks, books and photographs. The two model ships were of the Liberty Ship Ponce De Leon and the USS Constitution Ship, both structures impressive in their own right. The maritime photographs were arranged in chronological order, ranging from 19th century to the middle of the 20th century. The oldest being a photograph of the Merril-Stephens Engineering Company Building, 1903 and the most recent depicted a captured Nazi U-Boat visiting Jacksonville in 1944. This display was wonderfully diverse and captured the rich history of Jacksonville's maritime involvement.
