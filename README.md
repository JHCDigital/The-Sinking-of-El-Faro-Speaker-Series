This Speaker Series was presented by The Jacksonville History Center's very own Dr. Alan J. Bliss. He has served as CEO of the Jacksonville History Center since January 2018. Prior to then he taught U.S. history at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. His courses include urban history, maritime history, the Great Depression and the New Deal, Civil Rights, and proseminars on public history—all emphasizing Jacksonville. His research on modern Florida has won professional awards, and he has made presentations at numerous academic conferences nationwide. He consults widely on preservation and historic resources, and in 2015 he authored a fifty-year history of Jacksonville’s Haskell Company. Bliss’s memberships include the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce Downtown Council and the Naval Order of the United States. He is a member of Riverside Presbyterian Church, where he serves on the Property Committee. From 2017-2019, Bliss served on the Board of Directors of Fonkoze, USA, Inc., a microfinance organization directed at assistance for Haiti’s rural ultra-poor. Before to returning to higher education, he worked in the real estate industry and as a commercial mariner. He is an experienced offshore sailor, and continues to enjoy boating on the St. Johns River and surrounding waters.

# The S.S. El Faro
The S.S. El Faro was built in 1975 and served as a cargo vessel for forty years. It regularly sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. On September 29, 2015, the ship left Jacksonville, Florida’s harbor on what was expected to be a routine trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There was a hurricane brewing in line of their path named Joaquin, but at that time it was only declared a tropical storm. It only took a few days for Joaquin to escalate to a category 4 hurricane. El Faro pressed on despite the increasing risks, tragically underestimating the storm’s strength and trajectory. With the force of the storm the waves and wind crashed into the vessel, causing structural and mechanical challenges to expose themselves. The lower levels of the ship began to flood due to an open scuttle. The flooding caused the cargo to shift around, making the ship lose stability and list. Not long after the ship lost propulsion. With the El Faro unable to maneuver the crew worked tirelessly to manage the flooding, maintain communications with the Coast Guard and right the ship. Despite their efforts the El Faro was compromised and overwhelmed by the storm’s intensity. 

The crew of the EL Faro displayed remarkable bravery and professionalism as they faced issues that few mariners ever encounter. The crew followed procedures, relayed information and did everything they could to save the ship and each other. Thanks to investigations of the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Woods Hole Oceanic Institution the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was able to be recovered. The recordings captured the final 26 hours of the crew. At approximately 7:30 a.m. on October 1, Captain Michael Davidson reported that the ship had lost propulsion and was taking on water. By 10:00 a.m. all communication ceased. The El Faro and its crew were lost to the sea. A month later, on October 31, 2015, the wreckage was discovered near the Bahamas, approximately 15,000 feet below surface.

# Investigation
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the U.S. Coast Guard launched investigations after the loss of the El Faro and its crew. They were determined to find out what happened and how to prevent an occurrence like this in the future. The NTSB recommended safety enhancements while the U.S. Coast Guard assigned blame and recommended operational improvements. Both investigations led to identifying the contributing factors and command failures surrounding the loss. 

Contributing factors:
* Broken anemometer
* Exposed/unsecure hull penetrations
* Lagging tropical storm data
* Inadequate machinery preparations for heavy weather
* Antiquated lifeboats

Command failures:
* Loss of situational awareness
* TOTE’s lack of oversight
* Ship’s material condition and maintenance
* Communication surrounding hurricane Joaquin’s strength and track

The NTSB came out with several safety recommendations and called for stricter regulations and oversight on older vessels. They directly addressed the U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Communications Commission, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, TOTE Services Inc., amongst others in order to thouroughly identify and redirect those entities to make the changes needed. 


# Honoring the crew of the El Faro
Ten years have passed since October 1, 2015, still the memory of that day is deeply felt by families, friends, and the entire maritime community. In El Faro's wake came a lasting change through improvements in safety, communication, and oversight. Their legacy run every vessel that sails safer because of them, in every mariner who remembers their story, and in every heart that still carries their names.
