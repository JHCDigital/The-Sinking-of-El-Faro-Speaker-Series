# The S.S. El Faro
Built in 1975, the S.S. El Faro made voyages through Alaska, the Middle East, America and the Caribbean for 40 years. On September 29, 2015, the El Faro departed Jacksonville's port on a routine trip to San Juan. At the same time, Hurricane Joaquin was still being reported as a tropical storm. However, it was classified as a hurricane on September 30, increasing in power throughout the duration of its life cycle. The El Faro persisted through the storm that was escalating despite the weather warnings made clear by the National Hurricane Center. The El Faro captain and crew were navigating with an outdated understanding of the storm's rapid shifts after that point, continuing their path to Puerto Rico while Joaquin swelled to a category 4 hurricane. By the time the crew realized the severity of Joaquin the ship had already been severely compromised. At approximately 7:00 a.m. Captain Davidson reported a "navigational incident" to his company as the ship had lost its main propulsion unit and had suffered substantial damages, causing the boat to list and flood. At 7:17 a.m. the U.S. Coast Gaurd recieved a distress signal. At 7:39 a.m. Captain Davidson sounded the alarm for the crew to abandon ship. All recorded communications stopped after that point. The ship soon capsised with the crew still aboard. The wreckage of the El Faro was located and identified on October 31, 2015.
